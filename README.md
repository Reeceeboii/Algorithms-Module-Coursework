# Algorithms-Module-Coursework
The task for this piece of coursework was to make a tool to aid solving word search/crossword puzzles.
We were given a large word dictionary and were tasked in implementing efficient search and pattern matching algorithms that could find and output possible matches from this dictionary given a basic search pattern. 

So say, given pattern `bi..r.`, the program would search the dictionary and output words such as `bikers`, `binary` and `bistro`. We had to optimise our methods to make as few dictionary accesses as possible.

For the programming side of this coursework, I received 100% of the marks.
